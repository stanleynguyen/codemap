                        change how you guys look at computers, and feel more empowered to be creative with this

                        applications differ in their purposes, platforms but they all operate in the same general manner
                        of communicating in bits with hardwares like the screens to display pixels of colors, or the CPU
                        to make calculations. And these behaviors are predetermined by their creators whom we call
                        programmers.

                        job of programmers includes, communicating instructions to a computer to carry out useful tasks.
                        Now you understand why programmers are often quiet, because we have been "talking" all day to
                        our computers.

                        It's the exact same thing as telling someone to help you "go buy some grocery", just that
                        computers are scarily precise when it comes to instructions and make no assumption. You can tell
                        a person to "go buy milk and if there's eggs get a dozen" and the person will come back with a
                        bottle of milk and a dozen of eggs but a computer will come back with a dozen of milk bottles.
                        You will know why when you learn about conditional statements later in our course

                        this advancement is also the open doors to include many many more people to be creators, to
                        build on what their predecessors have done. And that's the power of software engineering or
                        engineering and applied science in general - being able to build upon a solid foundation of

                        from this diagram we're aiming to learn to work in the ever expanding middle region of the
                        pyramid. We will be working primarily in text, and learn how to express our ideas and intentions
                        in this format. It's not much of a difference from other subjects we took in school aint it?

                        signals, 0s and 1s. Hence, there must be something that sits in the middle to facilitate all

                        introduces an extra actor in the translation process to go from bytecodes to binary
                        instructions. This helps the bytecode becomes platform-agnostic as compared to our binaries from

                        After our deep diving in an attempt to make software look all less unicorn and magical, let's
                        get
                        back on track to prepare for our exciting modules ahead

                        All of our lessons will be taking place online as we are already doing it. The reason we insist
                        on online lessons as nowadays more and more companies are moving away from a physical in-office
                        culture to a remote-friendly one and these lessons can serve as a good practicing ground

                        As we have learnt and demistified source code files to actually be just text files with special
                        grammar based on what types of code like python or Go or Java, we will need a specialised text
                        editor for writing these effectively. VS Code is our recommended go-to choice as it's free and
                        comes with a very very diverse and well-maintained ecosystem of plugins for all kinds of needs
                        that might arise

                        Last but not least, there must be a way for us to work together on the same source code file to
                        teach and to learn more effectively through praciting. Enter liveshare, it's a VS Code plugin
                        that let me step in and pair program with you guys whenever help is needed.
