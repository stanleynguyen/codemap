    "0. How computers store information, run programs/scripts and different interfaces.\n",
    "    - Everything can be stored as a sequence of numbers, given some standard format.\n",
    "    - Specifically, binary is the natural way to store information digitally: numbers, text, pictures, sound, videos, etc.\n",
    "    - Computers have various recorded sets of instructions to perform basic tasks like move/copy data, compare values, add/subtract values etc (also in 0's and 1's - Machine Language).\n",
    "    - These basic functions can be combined to do more complicated stuff, like solve algebra, display videos, run computer games, etc. All of these work by following some sequence of instructions. Any such sequence of instruction is a _program_.\n",
    "    - Virtually everything is a \"program\" - some programmed list of instructions for the computer to follow. The input might be different each time the program is run, but the instructions remain the same.\n",
    "    - So although computers store everything in binary, its physical hardware (screens, speakers), coupled with some software (photo apps, music player apps..) can display or represent the stored data in dynamic ways - such as displaying coloured pictures on screens and playing a variety of sounds. The way you view content and/or communicate to the actual \"brain\" of the computer is through the _interface_. This can be textual (CLI) or graphical (GUI).\n",
    "    - Computer programming is how to design instructions for the computer to execute actions. It requires:\n",
    "        - Instructions written in a standardized programming language.\n",
    "        - A \"translator\" to convert these written instructions to machine code (0's and 1's) and execute the instructions. \n",
    "    - Python programming is basically writing instructions in Python, and sending these written instructions to the Python interpreter program to run. Usually the interface is textual."
